# React Native Guessing Game App

This is a simple guessing game app built using React Native, where the user picks a number between 1-100 and the phone guesses their number. The user tells the phone whether their number is higher or lower than the guess, and the phone keeps guessing until it correctly guesses the user's number. At the end of the game, the app displays a summary of all the guesses made, how many guesses were required to correctly guess the user's number, and allows the user to reset and play again.
